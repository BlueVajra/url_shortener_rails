# Implementing URL Shortener in Rails

## Development

1. Fork and clone repository
1. `rake db:create:all`
1. `rake spec`

## Assignment
Your assignment is to translate the URL shortener application
you worked on before into Rails.

Your only task is to make all of the failing/pending specs green.

You can use the [mockups](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gschool-project-assets/mockups.pdf)
to help you along the path.
